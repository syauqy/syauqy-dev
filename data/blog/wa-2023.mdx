Hey there! So, last month, my colleague Lukman and I, from JALA, embarked on a journey that was nothing short of amazing.
We found ourselves heading to Darwin, Australia, to attend the World Aquaculture Conference 2023, a hallmark event in our field.
Organized by the World Aquaculture Society (WAS), this conference is globally recognized as the go-to gathering for commercial, academic, and government sectors interested in aquaculture.

The World Aquaculture Society, with its firm "Commitment to Excellence," is pivotal in fostering the progressive development of aquaculture worldwide.
And boy, does the World Aquaculture Conference live up to that reputation! The WA 2023 was all about building the future of our industry under the theme of “Supporting Strength in Aquaculture."
Imagine being amidst a crowd of international community members – academics, industry researchers, market analysts, government officials, policymakers, and industry representatives – all there to exchange ideas and share their groundbreaking work.

And that's exactly where we found ourselves, not just as attendees, but as presenters.
Lukman and I had the unique opportunity to present our research work done at JALA.
My focus was on our fascinating research on predicting shrimp diseases using water quality data,
while Lukman demonstrated our innovative approach to shrimp sampling using a mobile phone.

But our involvement didn't stop there.
We also took part in an intriguing discussion titled "The Great Debate on Artificial Intelligence at the Service of Aquaculturists."
Alongside other industry thought leaders like Andrew Campbell (CEO of AQ1 Systems),
Paw Petersen (CEO of OxyGuard), and Jean-Yves Beninger (Southeast Asia Manager of BiOceanOr),
we dived into the potentials and challenges of AI in aquaculture.
