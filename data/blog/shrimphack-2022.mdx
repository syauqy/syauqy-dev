Last week, we hosted our first internal hackathon at JALA, aptly named ShrimpHack 2022. This thrilling and inspiring event brought together employees from various departments to collaborate and innovate. With three diverse themes to choose from, the hackathon aimed to foster a creative environment and provide an opportunity for everyone to contribute ideas and solutions related to aquaculture, sustainability, our working environment, or any other topic they were passionate about.

To make ShrimpHack 2022 a success, we assembled a dedicated team to handle planning and logistics. We started by setting clear objectives and devising three distinct themes for participants to choose from:

- Aquaculture and Sustainability: Addressing problems within the shrimp industry from upstream to downstream
- What's Around Our Office: Identifying and solving problems within our office environment
- Anything You Want: An open-ended theme encouraging participants to explore any topic they were passionate about
  We then worked on creating a set of rules and a structure for the event that would encourage collaboration and creativity among participants.

We wanted to ensure a high level of participation across the company, so we employed various promotional strategies, such as internal newsletters, posters, and team meetings, to spread the word about ShrimpHack 2022. To make the event even more appealing, we offered attractive prizes and rewards for the winning teams.

ShrimpHack 2022 took place over two days, with participants forming diverse teams that combined different areas of expertise, such as finance, legal, product development, and engineering. The cross-functional collaboration allowed teams to choose from one of the three themes, ensuring a wide range of unique perspectives and ideas.

It was truly exhilarating to witness teams brainstorming, discussing, and working together on innovative projects, whether it was addressing shrimp industry challenges, improving our office environment, or exploring entirely new ideas.

The results and learnings:
At the end of ShrimpHack 2022, we were blown away by the groundbreaking projects that the teams had developed, spanning all three themes. From cutting-edge aquaculture technologies to inventive ideas for promoting sustainability within our company and our industry, to creative solutions for improving our office environment, the results exceeded all expectations.

The feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing their gratitude for the opportunity to work with colleagues from different departments and to contribute to projects that aligned with their interests and passions.

This event taught us the immense value of cross-functional collaboration and the importance of fostering a creative environment that encourages employees to think outside the box and explore new ideas.

Our first internal hackathon, ShrimpHack 2022, was a resounding success, and I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who participated, contributed their time and expertise, and helped bring these amazing projects to life. The hackathon showcased the power of innovation and collaboration across diverse themes, and we can't wait to host similar events in the future. To other companies considering organizing their own internal hackathons, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try â€“ the results may surprise and inspire you! ðŸ¤Ÿ
