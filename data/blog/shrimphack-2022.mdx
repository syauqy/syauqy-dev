Last week, we hosted our first internal hackathon at JALA.

Teams were challenged to work on a problem related to aquaculture, sustainability, or ideas for improving our working environment .

It was really exciting to see people from finance, legal, and farm sit down with product and engineers to work on interesting projects. The results of this teamwork were better than I could have imagined!

I'd like to thank everyone who participated in the hackathon and congratulate you on creating amazing projects. ðŸ¤Ÿ
